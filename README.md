# AI Reinforcement Learning Models ðŸš€

This repository showcases my experiments and research in Reinforcement Learning (RL), focusing on simulation-based path optimization using algorithms like Monte Carlo methods and Deep Q-Learning (DQN).

## ðŸ§  Core Components

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Explores stochastic policy evaluation and improvement.
- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**: Trains an agent to learn optimal policies in grid-based environments.
- **IDEM-DQN Variant**: Includes implementation and results discussed in the attached project report.
- **Notebooks**:
  - `Rl.ipynb`: Core RL experiments using OpenAI Gym-style environments.
  - `Rlproject.ipynb`: A deep-dive into training results and visualization.
  - `rec_module.ipynb`: Personal experimentation notebook.

## ðŸ“„ Reports & Research

- `Literature review.pdf`: Summary of key reinforcement learning papers and methods.
- `Report_IDEM-DQN.docx`: Detailed implementation and experimental results.
- `IEEE_Conference_Template.pdf`: Research formatted for academic submission.

## ðŸ§ª Interactive Demo App

A simple web app using Streamlit demonstrates how an RL agent navigates a grid world to reach a goal. Useful for interviews and quick showcases.

### ðŸ”§ Run the App Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
